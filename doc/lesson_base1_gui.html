<h1>ABINIT, first (basic) lesson of the tutorial (GUI version):</h1>
<h2>The H<sub>2</sub> molecule, without convergence studies. </h2>
<hr>
<p>This lesson aims at showing how to get the following physical properties :
  <ul>
    <li>the (pseudo)total energy
    <li>the bond length
    <li>the charge density
    <li>the atomisation energy
  </ul>
  You will learn about the two input files, the basic input variables, the existence
  of defaults, the actions of the parser, and the use of the multi-dataset
  feature. You will also learn about the two output files as well as the density
  file. <p></p>
<p>This first lesson covers the sections 1, 3, 4 and 6 of the
  <a href="../users/abinit_help.html" target="helpsimg">abinit_help</a> file.</p>
<p>The very first step is a detailed tour of the input and output files : you
  are like a tourist, and you discover a town in a coach. You will have a bit
  more freedom after that first step ... <br>
  You don't need any knowledge of UNIX/Linux. </p>
<p>This lesson should take about 2 hours. </p>

<h3><b>1.1. The first step (the most important, and the most difficult !): <br>
  Computing the (pseudo) total energy, and some associated quantities.</b> </h3>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

If it is your first trial of the GUI, please read the GUI manual first (LINK).
For this lesson, we suppose you have already configured a machine on which abinit is installed.<br />

The first step is to create a simulation, click on the button "New Abinit Simu".<br />
Select the machine on which Abinit is compiled and installed in "Where to run simulation".
Now you have access to different sections: input file, pseudopotentials and pre-processing of the input file.<br />

As a starting point, click on the Browse button next to the input field text and select tbase1_1.in file.<br />
Now you can display the content and edit the file.<br />

Afterwards, please put "1" as ntypat and select the pseudopotential for hydrogen atom.<br />

If you want, you can also modify the "Submission" section with a different number of processors, for submission script or frontend.

Now let's try to run the simulation. Click on 


Note that the present tutorial will use four different windows:
one to visualize the text of the tutorial (the present window),
a second to run the code, a third to visualize
sections of the abinit_help file (that will open automatically),
and a fourth one for the description of input variables (that will also open automatically).
Try to manage adequately these four windows ...

<p><b>1.1.a</b> In addition to the present window,
open the second window. Go to the Tutorial directory (that we refer as ~abinit/tests/tutorial/Input).
<li> <i>cd ~abinit/tests/tutorial/Input</i></li><br>
In that directory, you will find the necessary input files to run the examples
related to this tutorial.
Take a few seconds to read the names of the files already
present in ~abinit/tests/tutorial/Input. Compare with the lessons mentioned in
the index of the <A href="welcome.html"><B>Tutorial home page</B></A>.
You will find other input files,
specifics for the Density Functional Perturbation Theory
("Response functions") capabilities of ABINIT
in the directory <i>~abinit/tests/tutorespfn/Input</i>.<br>

<p><b>1.1.b </b>You also need a working directory.
So, you should create a subdirectory
of this directory, whose name might be "Work" (so ~abinit/tests/tutorial/Input/Work).
Change the working directory of windows 2 to "Work":
<li> <i>mkdir Work</i> </li>
<li> <i>cd Work</i> </li>
<p> You will do most of the actions of this tutorial in this working directory.
  Copy the file tbase1_x.files in "Work" :
<li><i>cp ../tbase1_x.files . </i></li>

<p><b>1.1.c</b> Edit the tbase1_x.files.
  It is not very long (only 6 lines). It gives the information needed for the
  code to build other file names ... You will discover more about this file in
  the <a href="../users/abinit_help.html#intro1" target="helpsimg">section 1.1</a>
  of the abinit_help file. Please, read it now (it will take one minute or so).
  <a name="ref1"></a></p>

<p><b>1.1.d</b> Modify the first and second lines of tbase1_x.files file, so that they read:<br>
 tbase1_1.in <br>
 tbase1_1.out<br>
 Later, you will again modify these lines, to treat more cases. You should also change the last line,
that gives the location of the pseudopotential (suppress one occurrence of "../"). Close the tbase1_x.files file.
 Then, copy the file
 ~abinit/tests/tutorial/Input/tbase1_1.in</a> in "Work" :<br>
<li><i> cp ../tbase1_1.in . </i></li>

<p>
  Also later, we will look at this file, and learn about its content. For now,
  you will try to run the code. Its name is 'abinit'. The place where it can be
  found varies, according to the installation procedure. We will denote the
  directory where you have installed the package ~abinit. Supposing that
  you dumped the binaries from the Web site, then 'abinit' is to be found
  in the package, with location ~abinit/opt . If you dumped the sources
  from the Web site, and issued ./configure in the ~abinit directory,
  then it is located in ~abinit/src/main . In what follows, we will suppose
  that you can call it by simply typing "abinit", even if the
  actual command must be something like ../../../../opt/abinit or
  ../../../../src/main/abinit . (Suggestion : use an alias, copy the abinit executable, or declare the path).
<p>
  So, in the Work directory, type : <br>
  <li><i> abinit < tbase1_x.files >& log </i></li> <br>
  Wait a few seconds ... it's done !
  You can look at the content of the Work directory.
  <li><i> ls </i></li>
  <br>
  You should get something like
  <pre>
  abinit  log  tbase1_1.in  tbase1_1.out  tbase1_x.files  tbase1_xo_DDB  tbase1_xo_DEN  tbase1_xo_EIG  tbase1_xo_WFK
  </pre>
  Different output files have been created, including a "log" file and the
  output file "tbase1_1.out".
  To check that everything is correct, you
  can make a diff of tbase1_1.out with a reference file contained in the
  ~abinit/tests/tutorial/Refs directory :
 <li><i>diff tbase1_1.out ../../Refs/tbase1_1.out | more</i></li>
<p>(Perhaps you will need to ignore the blanks, with the command "diff -b" instead of "diff")
<p>That reference file uses slightly different file names. You should get some difference,
 but rather inoffensive ones, like differences in the name of input
  files or timing differences, e.g. : </p>

(... and what comes after that is related only to timing
  ...). If you do not run on a PC under Linux with Intel Fortran compiler, you might also have small numerical
differences, on the order of 1.0d-10 at most. You might also have other differences
in the paths of files. If you get something else, you should ask for help ! </p>
<p>Supposing everything went well, we will now detail the different
  steps that took place : how to run the code, what is in the "tbase1_1.in"
  input file, and, later, what is in the "tbase1_1.out"
  and "log" output files.</p>

<p><b>1.1.e</b> Running the code is described in the
  <a href="../users/abinit_help.html#exec" target="helpsimg">section 1.2</a>
  of the abinit_help file. Please, read it now (it will take 30 seconds or less).<a name="ref2"></a></p>

<p><b>1.1.f</b> It is now time to edit the tbase1_1.in file.
  You can have a first glance at it. It is not very long: about 50 lines, mostly
  comments. Do not try to understand everything immediately. After having gone
  through it, you should read general explanation about its content, and
  the format of such input files in the
  <a href="../users/abinit_help.html#intro3" target="helpsimg">section 3.1</a> of the abinit_help file.
  <a name="ref3"></a></p>

<p><b>1.1.g</b> You might now examine in more details some input variables. An
  alphabetically ordered <a href="../input_variables/keyhr.html" target="kwimg">index of all
  variables</a> is
  provided, and their description is found in the following files:
<ul>
<li> Basic variables, <A href="../input_variables/varbas.html">VARBAS</a></li>
<li> Developpement variables, <A href="../input_variables/vardev.html">VARDEV</a></li>
<li> Files handling variables, <A href="../input_variables/varfil.html">VARFIL</a></li>
<li> Geometry builder + symmetry related variables, <A href="../input_variables/vargeo.html">VARGEO</a></li>
<li> Ground-state calculation variables, <A href="../input_variables/vargs.html">VARGS</a></li>
<li> GW variables, <A href="../input_variables/vargw.html">VARGW</a></li>
<li> Internal variables, <A href="../input_variables/varint.html">VARINT</a></li>
<li> Parallelisation variables, <A href="../input_variables/varpar.html">VARPAR</a></li>
<li> Response Function variables, <A href="../input_variables/varrf.html">VARRF</a></li>
<li> Structure optimization variables, <A href="../input_variables/varrlx.html">VARRLX</a></li>
</ul>
  However, the number of such variables is rather large ! Note that
  a dozen of input variables were needed to run the first test case. This is possible
  because there are defaults values for the other input variables. When
  it exists, the default
  value is mentioned at the fourth line of the section related to each input variable,
  in the corresponding input variables file.
  Some input variables are also preprocessed, in order to derive
  convenient values for other input variables. Defaults are not existing or were
  avoided for the few input variables that you find in tbase1_1.in . These
  are particularly important input variables.
  So, take a few minutes to have a look at the input variables of tbase1_1.in :
  <ul>
  <li><a href="../input_variables/varbas.html#acell" target="kwimg">acell</a>,</li>
  <li><a href="../input_variables/varbas.html#ntypat" target="kwimg">ntypat</a>,</li>
  <li><a href="../input_variables/varbas.html#znucl" target="kwimg">znucl</a>,</li>
  <li><a href="../input_variables/varbas.html#natom" target="kwimg">natom</a>,</li>
  <li><a href="../input_variables/varbas.html#typat" target="kwimg">typat</a>,</li>
  <li><a href="../input_variables/varbas.html#xcart" target="kwimg">xcart</a>,</li>
  <li><a href="../input_variables/varbas.html#ecut" target="kwimg">ecut</a>,</li>
  <li><a href="../input_variables/varbas.html#nkpt" target="kwimg">nkpt</a>,</li>
  <li><a href="../input_variables/varbas.html#nstep" target="kwimg">nstep</a>,</li>
  <li><a href="../input_variables/varbas.html#toldfe" target="kwimg">toldfe</a>,</li>
  <li><a href="../input_variables/vargs.html#diemac" target="kwimg">diemac</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  Have also a look at <a href="../input_variables/varbas.html#kpt" target="kwimg">kpt</a>
  and <a href="../input_variables/varbas.html#iscf" target="kwimg">iscf</a>.

  <p> It is now time to have a look at the two output files of the run. </p>

<p><b>1.1.h</b> First, edit the "log" file. You
  can begin to read it. It is nasty. Jump to its end. You will find
  there the number of WARNINGS and COMMENTS that were issued by the code
  during execution. You might try to find them in the file
  (localize the keywords "WARNING" or "COMMENT" in this file). Some of them
  are for the experienced user. For the present time, we will ignore them. You
  can find more information about messages in the log file in the
  <a href="../users/abinit_help.html#logfile" target="helpsimg">section 6.1</a>
  of the abinit_help file.<a name="ref4"></a></p>

<p><b>1.1.i</b> Then, edit the "tbase1_1.out" file.
  You find some general information about the output file
  in <a href="../users/abinit_help.html#outputfile" target="helpsimg"> section 6.2</a>
  of the abinit_help file. You should also
  :
<ul>
    <li> examine the header of "tbase1_1.out"
    <li> examine the report on memory needs (do not read each value of parameters)
    <li> examine the echo of preprocessed input data,
  </ul>
  until you reach the message : <b><br>
  chkinp </b>: Checking input parameters for consistency. <p></p>
<p>If the code does not stop there, the input parameters are consistent. At this
  stage, many default values have been provided, and the preprocessing is finished.
</p>
<p>It is worth to come back to the echo of preprocessed input data. You should
  first examine the "tbase1_1.in" file in more
  details, and read the meaning of each of its variables in the
  corresponding input variables
  file, if it has not yet been done. Then, you should examine some variables
  that were NOT defined in the input file, but that appear in the echo written
  in "tbase1_1.out" : <br>
  <br>
  - "<a href="../input_variables/varbas.html#nband" target="kwimg">nband</a>" : its value is 2.
  <br>
  It is the number of electronic states that will be treated by the code. It has
  been computed by counting the number of valence electrons in the unit cell (summing
  the valence electrons brought by each pseudopotential) then occupying the lowest
  states (look at the "<a href="../input_variables/vargs.html#occ" target="kwimg">occ</a>" variable),
  and adding some states (at least one, maybe more, depending on the size of the
  system). <br>
  <br>
  - "<a href="../input_variables/vargs.html#ngfft" target="kwimg">ngfft</a>" : its value is 30
  30 30 . <br>
  It is the number of points of the three-dimensional FFT grid. It has been derived
  from "<a href="../input_variables/varbas.html#ecut" target="kwimg">ecut</a>" and the dimension
  of the cell ("<a href="../input_variables/varbas.html#acell" target="kwimg">acell</a>"). <br>
  <br>
  The maximal number of plane waves "<b>mpw</b>" is mentioned in the memory evaluation
  section: it is <b>752</b>. <br>
  Well, this is not completely right, as the code took advantage of the time-reversal
  symmetry, valid for the k-point (0 0 0), to decrease the number of planewave
  by about a factor of two. <br>
  The full set of plane waves is <b>1503</b> (see later in the "tbase1_1.out" file). <br>
  The code indicates the time-reversal symmetry by a value of <a href="../input_variables/vardev.html#istwfk" target="kwimg">istwfk</a>=2
  , instead of the usual <a href="../input_variables/vardev.html#istwfk" target="kwimg">istwfk</a>=1
  default. <br>
  <br>
  - "<a href="../input_variables/varbas.html#nsym" target="kwimg">nsym</a>" : its value is 16. <br>
  It is the number of symmetries of the system. The 3x3 matrices <a href="../input_variables/varbas.html#symrel" target="kwimg">symrel</a>
  define the symmetries operation. In this case, none of the symmetries is accompanied
  by a translation, that would appear in the variable "<a href="../input_variables/varbas.html#tnons" target="kwimg">tnons</a>".
  The code did an automatic analysis of symmetries. <br>
  They could alternatively be set by hand, or using the symmetry builder (to be
  described later). <br>
  <br>
  - "<a href="../input_variables/varbas.html#xangst" target="kwimg">xangst</a>" and "<a href="../input_variables/varbas.html#xred" target="kwimg">xred</a>"
  are alternative ways to "<a href="../input_variables/varbas.html#xcart" target="kwimg">xcart</a>"
  to specify the positions of atoms within the primitive cell. </p>
  <p>Now, you can start reading the description of the remaining
  of the tbase1_1.out file, in the <a href="../users/abinit_help.html#6.3" target="helpsimg"> section 6.3
  </a> of the abinit_help file.
  <a name="ref6"></a>Look at the tbase1_1.out
  file at the same time. </p>

<p><b><a name=1.1.j> 1.1.j </a> </b> You have read completely an output file ! </p>
<p>Could you answer the following questions ? </p>
<p>

<ul>
  <li><a name="q1">Q1</a>. How many SCF cycles were needed to have the <a href="../input_variables/varbas.html#toldfe" target="kwimg">toldfe</a>
    criterion satisfied ?
  <li><a name="q2">Q2</a>. Is the energy likely more converged than <a href="../input_variables/varbas.html#toldfe" target="kwimg">toldfe</a>

<h3><b><a name="12"></a>1.2. Computation
  of the interatomic distance (method 1). </b></h3>
<p><br>
  <b>1.2.a</b> <i>Starting from now, everytime a new input variable is mentioned,
  you should read the corresponding descriptive section in the ABINIT help.</i>
</p>
<p>We will now complete the description of the meaning of each term : there are
  still a few indications that you should be aware of, even if you will not use
  them in the tutorial. These might appear in the description of some input variables
  ...
  For this, you should read the <a href="../users/abinit_help.html#parameters" target="helpsimg">
  section 3.2</a> of the abinit_help file.<a name="ref7"></a></p>
<p><b>1.2.b</b> There are three methodologies to compute the optimal distance
  between the two Hydrogen atoms:
  <ul>
    <li> one could compute the <b>TOTAL ENERGY</b> for different values of the
      interatomic distance, make a fit through the different points, and determine
      the minimum of the fitting function ;
    <li> one could compute the <b>FORCES</b> for different values of the interatomic
      distance, make a fit through the different values, and determine the zero
      of the fitting function ;
    <li> one could use an automatic algorithm for minimizing the energy (or finding
      the zero of forces).
  </ul>
  We will begin with the computation of energy and forces for different values
  of the interatomic distance. This exercise will allow you to learn how to use
  multiple datasets. <p></p>
<p>The interatomic distance in the tbase1_1.in file was 1.4 Bohr. Suppose you decide
  to examine the interatomic distances from 1.0 Bohr to 2.0 Bohr, by steps of
  0.05 Bohr. That is, 21 calculations. <br>
  If you are a UNIX guru, it will be easy for you to write a script that will
  drive these 21 calculations, changing automatically the variable "<a href="../input_variables/varbas.html#xcart" target="kwimg">xcart</a>"
  in the input file, and then gather all the data, in a convenient form to be
  plotted. <br>
  Well, are you a UNIX guru ? If not, there is an easier path, all within ABINIT
  ! </p>
<p>This is the multi-dataset mode. Detailed explanations about it can be found in
  sections <a href="../users/abinit_help.html#multidataset" target="helpsimg">3.3</a>,
  <a href="../users/abinit_help.html#series" target="helpsimg">3.4</a>,
  <a href="../users/abinit_help.html#loop" target="helpsimg">3.5</a>
  and <a href="../users/abinit_help.html#3.6" target="helpsimg">3.6</a>,
  of the abinit_help file.<a name="ref8"></a></p>
<p><b>1.2.c</b> Now, can you write an input file that will do the computation
  described above (interatomic distances from 1.0 Bohr to 2.0 Bohr, by steps of
  0.05 Bohr) ? You might start from tbase1_1.in .
  Try to define a series, and to use
  the "<a href="../input_variables/varfil.html#getwfk" target="kwimg">getwfk</a>"
  input variable (the latter will make the computation much faster). </p>
<p>You should likely have a look at the section that describes the "<a href="../input_variables/varfil.html#irdwfk" target="kwimg">irdwfk</a>"
  and "<a href="../input_variables/varfil.html#getwfk" target="kwimg">getwfk</a>" input variables:
  in particular, look at the meaning of <i><b>getwfk -1</b></i> </p>
<p>Also, define explicitely the number of states (or supercell "bands") to be
  one, using the input variables "<a href="../input_variables/varbas.html#nband" target="kwimg">nband</a>".
  The input file ~abinit/tests/tutorial/Input/tbase1_2.in is an example of
  file that will do the job, while ~abinit/tests/tutorial/Refs/tbase1_2.out
  is an example of output file. If you decide to use the ~abinit/tests/tutorial/Input/tbase1_2.in file,
  do not forget to change the file names in the tbase1_x.files file ... </p>
<p>So, you run the code with your input file (this might take fifteen seconds or so on a PC at 3 GHz),
  examine the output file quickly
  (there are many repetition of sections, for the different datasets), and get
  the output energies gathered in the final echo of variables :</p>

<h3><b><a name="13"></a>1.3 Computation of the interatomic distance (method 2). </b></h3>

<p><br><b>1.3.a</b> The other methodology is based on an automatic computation of
  the minimum. <br>
  There are different algorithms to do that.
  See the input variable "<a href="../input_variables/varrlx.html#ionmov" target="kwimg">ionmov</a>",
  with values 2, 3 and 7. In the present case, with only one degree of freedom
  to be optimized, the best choice
  is <a href="../input_variables/varrlx.html#ionmov" target="kwimg">ionmov</a> 3 . </p>
<p>You have also to define the maximal number of timesteps for this optimization.
  Set the input variable "<a href="../input_variables/varrlx.html#ntime" target="kwimg">ntime</a>"
  to 10, it will be largely enough.
  For the stopping criterion "<a href="../input_variables/varrlx.html#tolmxf" target="kwimg">tolmxf</a>",
  use the reasonable value of 5.0d-4 Ha/Bohr. This defines the force treshold
  to consider that the geometry is converged. The code will stop if the residual
  forces are below that value before
  reaching "<a href="../input_variables/varrlx.html#ntime" target="kwimg">ntime</a>".
</p>
<p>It is also worth to change the stopping criterion for the SCF cycle, in order
  to be sure that the forces generated for each trial interatomic distance are
  sufficiently converged. Indeed, the value used for 
  <a href="../input_variables/varbas.html#toldfe" target="kwimg">toldfe</a>, namely 1.0d-6,
  might be sufficient for total energy calculations, but definitely not for
  the accurate computation of other properties.
  So, change "<a href="../input_variables/varbas.html#toldfe" target="kwimg">toldfe</a>"
  in "<a href="../input_variables/varbas.html#toldff" target="kwimg">toldff</a>", and set the latter
  input variable to ten times smaller than
  "<a href="../input_variables/varrlx.html#tolmxf" target="kwimg">tolmxf</a>".
  The input file ~abinit/tests/tutorial/Input/tbase1_3.in is an example of
  file that will do the job, while ~abinit/tests/tutorial/Refs/tbase1_3.out
  is an example of output file. If you decide to use these files, do not forget
  to change the file names in the tbase1_x.files"
  file ... So, you run the code with your input file (a few seconds),
  examine quietly this file (which
  is much smaller than the tbase1_2.out file), and get some significant output data gathered in the
  final echo of variables : </p>
<pre>
    etotal   -1.1058360644E+00
     fcart    1.8270533893E-04  0.0000000000E+00  0.0000000000E+00
             -1.8270533893E-04  0.0000000000E+00  0.0000000000E+00
      ...
     xcart   -7.6091015760E-01  0.0000000000E+00  0.0000000000E+00
              7.6091015760E-01  0.0000000000E+00  0.0000000000E+00
</pre>

<p> According to these data (see <a href="../input_variables/varbas.html#xcart" target="kwimg">xcart</a>),
  the optimal interatomic distance is about 1.522 Bohr, in good agreement
  with the estimation of tbase1_2.out .
  If you have time (this is to be done at home), you might try to change the
  stopping criteria, and redo the calculation, to see the level of convergence
  of the interatomic distance. </p>
<p> Note that the final value of fcart in your run might differ slightly from the one
shown above (less than one percent change). Such a fluctuation is quite
often observed for a value converging to zero (remember, we ask the code
to determine the equilibrium geometry, that is, forces should be zero)
when the same computation is done on different platforms.

<h3><b><a name="14"></a>1.4. Computation of the charge density.</b>
</h3>

The charge density has already been computed, for all geometries, in the above-mentioned runs.
Here, we will print this quantity.

<p><b>1.4.a</b> We start from the optimized interatomic distance 1.522 Bohr,
  and make a run at fixed geometry.
  The input variable "<a href="../input_variables/varfil.html#prtden" target="kwimg">prtden</a>"
  must be set to 1.
  To understand correctly the content of the
  "<a href="../input_variables/varfil.html#prtden" target="kwimg">prtden</a>"
  description, it is worth to read a much more detailed description of the "files" file,
  in <a href="../users/abinit_help.html#4" target="helpsimg">section 4 </a> of the abinit_help file.
  <a name="ref9"></a></p>

<p><b>1.4.b</b> The input file ~abinit/tests/tutorial/Input/tbase1_4.in is
  an example of input file for a run that will print a density.
  If you decide to use this file,
  do not forget to change the file names in tbase1_x.files.
  The run will take a few seconds. </p>
<p>The density will be output in the <b>tbase1_xo_DEN</b> file. Try to edit it ...
  No luck ! This file is unformatted, not written using the ASCII code. Even if
  you cannot read it, its description is provided in the abinit_help. It contains
  first a header, then the density numbers. The description of the header
  is presented in <a href="../users/abinit_help.html#header" target="helpsimg">section 6.4</a>
  of the abinit_help file, while the body of the _DEN file is presented
  in <a href="../users/abinit_help.html#densoutputfile" target="helpsimg">section 6.5</a>.
  It is the appropriate time to read also the description of the potential
  files and wavefunctions files, as these files contain the same header as the
  density file, see sections
  <a href="../users/abinit_help.html#localpotfile" target="helpsimg">6.6</a>
  and
  <a href="../users/abinit_help.html#wavefctfile" target="helpsimg">6.7</a>
  <a name="ref10"></a></p>

<p><b>1.4.c</b> Such a density file can be read by ABINIT, to restart a calculation
  (see the input variable <a href="../input_variables/varbas.html#iscf" target="kwimg">iscf</a>,
  when its value is -2), but more usually, by an utility called "cut3d". This
  utility is available in the ABINIT package.
  You might try to use it now, to generate two-dimensional
  cuts in the density, and visualize the charge density contours.
<br>Read the corresponding <a href="../users/cut3d_help.html" target="helpsimg">Cut3D help file</a>.
  Then, try to run cut3d to analyse <b>tbase1_xo_DEN</b>.
  You should first try to translate the unformatted density data to indexed formatted data,
  by using option 6 in the adequate menu. Save the indexed formatted data to file <b>tbase1_xo_DEN_indexed</b>.
  Then, edit this file, to have an idea of the content of the _DEN files.
<br>For further treatment, you might choose to select another option than 6. In particular,
 if you have access to MATLAB, choose option 5. With minor modifications (set ngx=ngy=ngz to 30)
 you will be able to use the file dim.m present in ~abinit/doc/tutorial/lesson_base1 to visualize the
 3-Dimensional isosurfaces. Another option might be to use the XCrysDen software,
 for which you need to use option 9.

<h3><b><a name="15"></a>1.5. Computation of the atomisation energy.</b>
</h3>
<p><b>1.5.a</b>
The atomisation energy is the energy needed to separate a molecule
in its constituent atoms, each being neutral.
<br>
  In the present case, one must compute first the total energy of an isolated
  hydrogen atom. The atomisation energy will be the difference between the total
  energy of H<sub>2</sub> and twice the total energy of H . <br>
  There are some subtleties in the calculation of an isolated atom.
<ul>
  <li>in many cases, the ground state of an isolated atom is spin-polarized, see
    the variables "<a href="../input_variables/varbas.html#nsppol" target="kwimg">nsppol</a>" and
    "<a href="../input_variables/vargs.html#spinat" target="kwimg">spinat</a>" ;
  <li>the highest occupied level might be degenerate with the lowest unoccupied
    level of the same spin, in which case the techniques usually appropriate for metals
    are to be used (see <a href="lesson_base4.html">lesson_base4</a>)
  <li>also often, the symmetry of the ground-state charge density will NOT be
    spherical, so that the automatic determination of symmetries by the code,
    based on the atomic coordinates, should be disabled, see the input variable
    "<a href="../input_variables/varbas.html#nsym" target="kwimg">nsym</a>", to be set to 1 in this
    case.
</ul>
<br>
For Hydrogen, we are lucky that the ground state is spherical (1s orbital), and
that the highest occupied level and lowest unoccupied level, although degenerate,
have a different spin. We will define by hand the occupation of each spin, see
the input variables <a href="../input_variables/varbas.html#occopt" target="kwimg">occopt</a> (to
be set to 2), and <a href="../input_variables/vargs.html#occ" target="kwimg">occ</a> . <br>
Finally, in order to make numerical errors cancel, it is important
to compute the above-mentioned difference in the same box, for the same
cut-off, and even for a location in the box that is similar to the
molecule case (although the latter might not be so important).

<p>The input file ~abinit/tests/tutorial/Input/tbase1_5.in is an example
  of file that will do the job, while ~abinit/tests/tutorial/Refs/tbase1_5.out
  is an example of output file. If you decide to use the tbase1_5.in file, do not forget
  to change the file names in the tbase1_x.files file. The run lasts a few seconds.

<p>You should read the output file, and note the tiny differences
related with the spin-polarisation :
<ul>
<li>the electronic eigenvalues are now given for both spin up and
 spin down cases :
<pre>
 Eigenvalues (hartree) for nkpt=   1  k points, SPIN UP:
 kpt#   1, nband=  1, wtk=  1.00000, kpt=  0.0000  0.0000  0.0000 (reduced coord)

</pre>
</ul>
<br>
The <b>zeta</b> variable is the ratio between the spin-density difference and
the charge density. It varies between +1 and -1. In the present case of Hydrogen,
there is no spin down density, so the zeta variable is +1.
<br>(Comment : in this part of the output file, note the comma "," that is inserted
in the first column. This is not important for the user : it is used to post-process the
output file using some automatic tool. As a rule, you should ignore symbols placed
in the first column of the ABINIT output file.)
<p>The total energy is
<pre>
    etotal   -4.7010531489E-01
</pre>
while the total energy of the H<sub>2</sub> molecule is (see test 13):
<pre>
    etotal   -1.1058360644E+00
</pre>

<p>The atomisation energy is thus 0.1656 Ha (The difference between the total energy of the H2 molecule and twice the energy of an isolated Hydrogen atom).

<p>At this stage, we can compare our results :
<ul>
<li>bond length : 1.522 Bohr
<li>atomisation energy at that bond length : 0.1656 Ha = 4.506 eV
</ul>

with the experimental data as well as theoretical data using
a much more accurate technique
(see <cite>Kolos and Roothaan, Rev. Mod. Phys. 32, 219 (1960)</cite>, especially p.225)
<ul>
<li>bond length : 1.401 Bohr
<li>atomisation energy : 4.747 eV
</ul>
<br>The bond length is awful (nearly 10% off),
and the atomisation energy is a bit too low, 5 % off.

<p>What is wrong ??
<br>Well, are you sure that the input parameters that we did not discuss
are correct ? These are :
<ul>
  <li><a href="../input_variables/varbas.html#ecut" target="kwimg">ecut</a> (the plane-wave kinetic
    energy cut-off)
  <li><a href="../input_variables/varbas.html#acell" target="kwimg">acell</a> (the supercell size)
  <li><a href="../input_variables/varbas.html#ixc" target="kwimg">ixc</a> (not even mentioned until
    now, this input variable specifies what kind of exchange-correlation functional
    is to be used ...)
  <li>the pseudopotential
</ul>
<br>
We used 10 Ha as cut-off energy, a 10x10x10 Bohr^3 supercell, the local-density
approximation (as well as the local-spin-density approximation) in the Teter parametrization,
and a pseudopotential from the Goedecker-Hutter-Teter table (<cite>Phys. Rev.
B 54, 1703 (1996)</cite>).
<p>We will see in the <a href="lesson_base2.html">next lesson</a> how to address the

 At SCF step    6, etot is converged :
  for the second time, diff in etot=  9.037E-11 < toldfe=  1.000E-06
</pre>
Note that the number of steps that were allowed, <a href="../input_variables/varbas.html#nstep" target="kwimg">nstep</a>=10,
is larger than the number of steps effectively needed to reach the stopping criterion.
As a rule, you should always check that the number of steps that you allowed
was sufficient to reach the target tolerance. You might now play a bit with nstep, as e.g. set it
to 5, to see how ABINIT reacts.
<p>Side note : in most of the tutorial examples, <a href="../input_variables/varbas.html#nstep" target="kwimg">nstep</a>
will be enough to reach the
target tolerance, defined by one of the "tolXXX" input variables. However, this is not always the case
(e.g. the test case 1 of the <a href="lesson_rf1.html">lesson response-function 1</a>),
because of some portability problems, that could only be solved by stopping the SCF cycles
before the required tolerance.

<p><b>Q2.</b> The information is contained in the same piece of the output file. Yes, the energy is more converged than <a href="../input_variables/varbas.html#toldfe" target="kwimg">toldfe</a>,
  since the stopping criterion asked for the difference between successive evaluations
  of the energy to be smaller than <a href="../input_variables/varbas.html#toldfe" target="kwimg">toldfe</a>
  twice in a row, while the evolution of the energy is nice, and always decreasing
  by smaller and smaller amounts.
