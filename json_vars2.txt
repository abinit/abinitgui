In case <b>accesswff</b>=1, note the following. MPI/IO routines might be much more efficient than usual Fortran IO
routines in the case of a large number of processors, with a pool of
disks attached globally to the processors, but not one disk attached
to each processor. For a cluster of workstations, where each processor
has his own temporaries, the use of <b>accesswff</b>=0 might be perfectly
allright. This option is useful only if one is using the band-FFT parallelism.
MPI/IO routines are available in the MPI-2 library, but usually not in the MPI-1 library. So, perhaps you cannot
use <b>accesswff</b>=1.
<br>
In case <b>accesswff</b>=3, note that not only the wavefunctions will be written using the ETSF_IO routines,
but also, the same input variable governs the writing of the density and potential, that can also be
written using ETSF_IO routines. In order to use <b>accesswff</b>=3, you need to have the plug-in library ETSF_IO
working (see the documentation of the build system).

<img style="width: 461px; height: 49px;" src="./vargw_img/self_energy_cd.png">
</p>
<p>
Where <span style="font-family:Times,Serif"><i>&omega;</i></span> is the frequency point along the real axis,
<span style="font-family:Times,Serif"><i>&epsilon;<sub>s</sub></i></span> is an eigenvalue,
and <span style="font-family:Times,Serif"><i>i&omega;'</i></span> is the variable along the
imaginary axis. Thus the function to be integrated
is a Lorentzian weight function centred on the origin (whose FWHM is decided by
|<span style="font-family:Times,Serif"><i>&omega; - &epsilon;<sub>s</sub></i></span>|),
times a function. The function is related to the inverse dielectric matrix. It might have a peaked structure near the origin and is very smooth otherwise. the function decays
asymptotically as <span style="font-family:Times,Serif">1 / <i>i&omega;'</i></span>, so the whole
integral converges as this to the third power.
<ul>
<li><b>cd_frqim_method = 1 - Histogram:</b> This is the <b>default</b> method where the function
<span style="font-family:Times,Serif"><i>f(i&omega;')</i></span> is approximated by a histogram,
and the Lorentzian is integrated analytically in each sub-interval. See the section on grids
below for a description of the default grid. This method combined with the default grid is the
fastest and optimised for the use of few points along the imaginary axis.

<li><b>cd_frqim_method = 2 - Trapezoid:</b> The next step up from the histogram approximation in the previous
method. The integration region is transformed
<span style="font-family:Times,Serif"><i>[0,&#8734;[ &rarr; [0,1]</i></span> with a proper
weight depending on the width of the Lorentian. In this space
<span style="font-family:Times,Serif"><i>f(i&omega;')</i></span>
is approximated by a linear function between grid points (trapezoids), and the integrand is
integrated analytically in each sub-interval. This method tends to slightly overestimate contributions
while the default method tends to slightly underestimate them, so the results from methods
1 and 2 should bracket the converged values. The asymptotic behaviour is explicitly taken
into account by a fit using the last two grid points.

<li><b>cd_frqim_method = 3, 4, 5 - Natural Spline:</b> The function is transfomed <span style="font-family:Times,Serif"><i>[0,&#8734;[ &rarr; [0,1]</i></span>. In this space <span style="font-family:Times,Serif"><i>f(i&omega;')</i></span> is approximated by a natural spline function whose starting and ending sections are linear. This transform is chosen so that the function should approach a linear function asymptotically as the integration interval approaches 1, so that the asymptotic behaviour is automatically taken into account. For each Lorenzian width
(determined by |<span style="font-family:Times,Serif"><i>&omega; - &epsilon;<sub>s</sub></i></span>|)
the integrand is appropriately scaled in the interval
<span style="font-family:Times,Serif"><i>[0,1]</i></span>, and a nested Gauss-Kronrod (GK)
numerical integration rule is performed. The integrand is evaluated at the GK nodes by means
of a spline-fit. The order of the GK rule is controlled by the index of the method:
<ul>
<li><b>3 =&gt; Gauss  7 point, Kronrod 15 point rule </b>
<li><b>4 =&gt; Gauss 11 point, Kronrod 23 point rule </b>
<li><b>5 =&gt; Gauss 15 point, Kronrod 31 point rule </b>
</ul>
There is rarely any difference to machine precision between these rules, and the code will
issue a warning if a higher-order rule is recommended.

</ul>

<p>
<b>Grids for the integral along the imaginary axis:</b>
<p>
All the methods above should execute no matter what grid is used along the imaginary axis, so this
is very much under the user's control. The only requirement is that the grid be strictly increasing.
The point at zero frequency is assumed to lie on the real axis, so the calculation of that point
is controlled by <a href="vargw.html#nfreqre">nfreqre</a> and corresponding variables. We highly
recommend extracting various elements of the dielectric matrix from the _SCR file using
the <B>Mrgscr</B> utility and plotting them for visual inspection.

<span style="font-family:Times,Serif"><i>&alpha;</i></span> is a parameter which determines
how far out the final grid point will lie. The final point will be at
<span style="font-family:Times,Serif"><i>&alpha;&middot;&omega;<sub>p<sub></i></span>
(the default is <span style="font-family:Times,Serif"><i>&alpha; = 5</i></span>,
and was hard-coded in older versions of ABINIT).
This grid is designed so that approximately half the grid points are always distributed
to values lower than the plasma frequency, in order to resolve any peaked structure. If one
seeks to increase the outermost reach by increasing <a href="vargw.html#ppmfrq">ppmfrq</a>
one must simultaneously take care to increase <a href="vargw.html#nfreqim">nfreqim</a>
in order to have the appropriate resolution for the low-frequency region.
In more recent versions of ABINIT one can also simply adjust the parameter
<span style="font-family:Times,Serif"><i>&alpha;</i></span> by using
<a href="vargw.html#freqim_alpha">freqim_alpha</a>. This grid is optimised for
speed and accurate results with few gridpoints for <b>cd_frqim_method = 1</b>.
<li><b>Inverse z transform</b> - This grid is activated by the use of the variable
<a href="vargw.html#gw_frqim_inzgrid">gw_frqim_inzgrid</a>. This is the standard
<span style="font-family:Times,Serif"><i>[0,&#8734;[ &rarr; [0,1]</i></span> transform
using the formula:
<p align="center">
<img style="width: 122px; height: 38px;" src="./vargw_img/cd_inzgrid.png">
</p>Here <span style="font-family:Times,Serif"><i>&omega;<sub>p</sub></i></span> is the
plasma frequency (default can be overridden by setting <a href="vargw.html#ppmfrq">ppmfrq</a>).
The gridpoints are then picked by an equidistant grid (number of points set by
<a href="vargw.html#nfreqim">nfreqim</a>) in the interval
<span style="font-family:Times,Serif"><i>z &sub; [0,1]</i></span>. This grid can easily
be uniquely converged by just increasing <a href="vargw.html#nfreqim">nfreqim</a>. Again
the points are distributed so that approximately half of them lie below the plasma frequency.
<li><b>User defined</b> - The user can also define their own grid using the variables
<a href="vargw.html#nfreqim">cd_customnimfrqs</a> and
<a href="vargw.html#nfreqim">cd_imfrqs</a>. <i>With great power comes great responsibility!</i>
</ul>
<p>
The <B>Mrgscr</B> utility is handy in optimising the numerical effort expended in convergence studies.
By estimating the densest grid one can afford to calculate in the SCR file, and succesively removing
frequencies from a single file (using the utility), one only needs to perform the screening
calculation <b>once</b> on the dense mesh for a given convergence study. One can also use the utility to
merge independent screening calculations over q-points and frequency sections.

This variable governs the behaviour of the code when there are potential

When <b>chksymbreak</b>=1, the code stops if :
<ul>
<li>(1) The k point grid is non-symmetric, in case <a href="varbas.html#nsym">kptopt</a>=1, 2, or 4 ;</li>
<li>(2) The non-symmorphic translation part of the symmetry operations has components that are not zero,

</ul>
<br>When <b>chksymbreak</b> is zero, there is no such check.
<br>When <b>chksymbreak</b> is minus 1, the code stops if the condition (1) is met, but in case the condition (2) is met, there will be a trial
to shift the atomic coordinates such as to obtain symmetry operations with the adequate non-symmorphic part.

<p>Explanation :
<br>In the ground-state calculation, such breaking of the symmetry is usually harmless. However, if the user is doing a
calculation of phonons using DFPT (<a href="varrf.html#rfphon">rfphon</a>=1), the convergence with respect to the number of k points will
be much worse with a non-symmetric grid than with a symmetric one. Also, if the user is doing a GW calculation, the
presence of non-symmorphic translations that are not coherent with the FFT grid might cause
problems.
In the GW part, indeed, one needs to reconstruct the wavefunctions in the full Brillouin zone for
calculating both the polarizability and the self-energy.
The wavefunctions in the full Brillouin zone are obtained from the irreducible wedge by applying the symmetry
operations of the space group of the crystal.
In the present implementation, the symmetrization of the wavefunctions is done in real space on the FFT mesh
that, therefore, has to be coherent both with the rotational part as well as with the fractional translation
of each symmetry operation.
If the condition (2) is met, the GW code won't be able to find a symmetry-preserving FFT mesh.
<br>So, it was decided to warn the user about these possible problems already at the level of the ground state calculations,
although such warning might be irrelevant.
<br>If you encounter a problem outlined above, you have two choices : change your atomic positions (translate them) such that the origin
appears as the most symmetric point ; or ignore the problem, and set <b>chksymbreak</b>=0 .

Used for screening length (in Bohr) of the model
dielectric function, diagonal in reciprocal space.
By default, given in Bohr atomic units
(1 Bohr=0.5291772108 Angstrom), although Angstrom can be specified,
if preferred, since <b>dielng</b> has the
'<a href="../users/abinit_help.html#dimensions">LENGTH</a>' characteristics.
<br>
This model dielectric function is as follows :
<pre>
(     1        + <b>dielng</b><sup>2</sup> * K<sup>2</sup> )
diel(K)= --------------------------------------------
( 1/<a href="vargs.html#diemac">diemac</a> + <b>dielng</b><sup>2</sup> * K<sup>2</sup> ) * <a href="vargs.html#diemix">diemix</a>
</pre>
The inverse of this model dielectric function will be
applied to the residual, to give the preconditioned
change of potential. Right at K=0, diel(K) is imposed to be 1.
<p>If the preconditioning were perfect,
the change of potential would lead to an exceedingly fast solution
of the self-consistency problem (two or three steps).
The present model dielectric function is excellent for
rather homogeneous unit cells.
<br>When K->0 , it tends to the macroscopic dielectric
constant, eventually divided by the mixing factor <a href="vargs.html#diemix">diemix</a>
(or <a href="vargs.html#diemix">diemixmag</a> for magnetization).
<br>For metals, simply put <a href="vargs.html#diemac">diemac</a> to a very large value (10^6 is OK)
<br>The screening length <b>dielng</b> governs the length scale
to go from the macroscopic regime to the microscopic
regime, where it is known that the dielectric function
should tend to 1. It is on the order of 1 Bohr for
metals with medium density of states at the Fermi level,
like Molybdenum, and for Silicon. For metals with a
larger DOS at the Fermi level (like Iron),
the screening will be more effective, so that <b>dielng</b>
has to be decreased by a factor of 2-4.
<br>This works for GS and RF calculations.

A rough knowledge of the macroscopic dielectric constant <b>diemac</b>

a model dielectric function,
see the keyword <a href="vargs.html#dielng">dielng</a>, is used for that
purpose.  It is especially
useful for speeding up the treatment of rather homogeneous unit cells.
<p>Some hint :
<br>The value of <b>diemac</b> should usually be bigger than 1.0d0,
on physical grounds.
<br>For metals, simply put <b>diemac</b> to a very large value (the default 10<sup>6</sup> is OK)

badly treated by the model dielectric function. One has to use the

<br>In sufficiently homogeneous systems, you might have to experiment
a bit to find the best <b>diemac</b>. If you let <b>diemac</b>

Indeed, in the String Method or the Nudged Elastic Band, one might impose that the extremal configurations of the string are fixed.
In case the <b>dynimage</b>(iimage)=0, the image with index "iimage" will be consider as fixed.
Thus, there is no need to compute forces and stresses for this image at each time step. The purpose of
nevertheless defining extremal images is to make the input/output easier.<br><br>
In order to save CPU time, the computation of properties of static images (<b>dynimage</b>(iimage)=0)
can be avoided: see <a href="varrlx.html#istatimg">istatimg</a> keyword.

<p>
The basic ingredients needed to perform both a screening and a sigma calculation are the so-called
oscillator matrix elements defined as

<br><br> $<
<B>k-q</B>, b1 | e^{-i (<B>q+G</B>).<B>r</B>} | <B>k</B> b2 >$ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1)
<br><br>

In reciprocal space, Eq.1 is given by a convolution in which the number of reciprocal
lattice vectors employed to describe the wavefunctions is given
by <a href="vargw.html#ecutwfn">ecutwfn</a>
Tn the case of screening calculations, the number of <B>G</B> vectors in Eq.1 is defined
by <a href="vargw.html#ecuteps">ecuteps</a>,
while <a href="vargw.html#ecutsigx">ecutsigx</a> defined the number of <B>G</B> used in sigma calculations.
To improve the efficiency of the code, the oscillator matrix elements are evaluated
in real space through FFT techniques, and the <b>fftgw</b> input variable is used to select the FFT
mesh to be used.
<p>
<b>fftgw</b> is the concatenation of two digits, labelled (A) and (B) whose value is internally used
to define the value of  <a href="vargs.html#ngfft">ngfft</a>(1:3) (see the setmesh.F90 routine).
<p>
The first digit (A) defines the augmentation of the FFT grid. Possible values are 1, 2 and 3.

<ul>
<li> 0 =&gt; Use the FFT grid specified by the user through <a href="vargs.html#ngfft">ngfft</a>(1:3) </li>
<li> 1 =&gt; Use a coarse FFT grid which encloses a sphere in reciprocal space whose radius depends
on the largest value between
<a href="vargw.html#ecutwfn">ecutwfn</a> and <a href="vargw.html#ecuteps">ecuteps</a> </li>
<li> 2 =&gt;  Use a slightly augmented FFT which is sufficient for the correct treatment of the
convolution
<li> 3 =&gt; Doubled FFT grid (same mesh as that used for GS calculations).</li>
</ul>

<p>
The second digit (B) can be chosen between 0 and 1. It defines whether a FFT grid compatible with all
the symmetries of the space group must be enforced or not:

<ul>
<li> 0 =&gt; Use the smallest FFT mesh which is compatible with the FFT library (faster, save memory
but is less accurate)</li>
<li> 1 =&gt; Enforce a FFT grid which is compatible with all the symmetry operations of the space
group. This method leads to an increase both of CPU time and memory, but the matrix elements
are more accurate since the symmetry properties of the system are preserved.</li>

Theoretical introduction: GW calculations perfomed on top of electronic calculations relying
when the frozen-core approximation is used to separate inner-core electrons from valence electrons,
only the contribution to the self-energy arising from valence electrons is explicitly accounted for.
In the standard approach based on pseudopotentials the contribution to the self-energy due to core electrons is approximated
by means of the KS exchange-correlation potential generated by the core density.
In the case of GW calculations employing the PAW method, the core contribution to the self-energy
can be more accurately estimated in terms of the Fock operator generated by the core wavefunctions.
In the simplest approach, the only ingredients required for this more refined treatment are the wave
functions of the core electrons in the reference atomic configuration that are calculated during the
generation of the PAW setup. This is a good approximation provided that the core wave functions
are strictly localized inside the PAW spheres.

of the kind first published by H. Yoshida [Construction of higher order symplectic

This algorithm requires at least 14 evaluation of the forces (actually 15 are done
within Abinit) per time step. At this cost it usually gives much better
energy conservation than the verlet algorithm (ionmov 6) for a 30 times bigger
value of <a href="varrlx.html#dtion">dtion</a>. Notice that the potential

Given a starting point xred that is a vector of length 3*natom
(reduced nuclei coordinates), and unit cell parameters (rprimd)
this routine uses the DIIS (direct inversion of the iterative
subspace) to minize the gradient (forces) on atoms. The preconditioning
used to compute errors from gradients is using an inversed hessian
matrix obtained by a BFGS algorithm.
This method is known to converge to the nearest point where gradients
vanish. This is efficient to refine positions around a saddle point
for instance.

<li>23=&gt; Use of Learn on The Fly method (LOTF) for Molecular Dynamics.
In the framework of isokinetic MD, the atomic forces and positions are computed
by using LOTF interpolation.
A SCF computation is performed only any <a href="vardev.html#lotf_nitex">lotf_nitex</a>
steps. The results of the SCF are used to compute the parameters of a
short range classical potential (for the moment only the glue potential for gold is implemented).
Then these parameters are continuosly tuned to compute atomic trajectories.
LOTF has to be enabled at configure time. If LOTF is not enable and ionmov=23,
abinit will set automatically ionmov=12.<br>
The LOTF cycle is divided in the following steps:<br>
a) Initializaition (SFC at t=0) and computation of potential parameters.<br>
b) Extrapolation of the atomic forces and positions for <a href="vardev.html#lotf_nitex">lotf_nitex</a> time step.
To perform this extrapolation, the potential computed in a) is used (Verlet algorithm).<br>
c) SFC at t=<a href="vardev.html#lotf_nitex">lotf_nitex</a>. Computation of the potential parameters. <br>
d) LOTF interpolation, linear interpolation of the potential parameters and computation of the atomic
forces and positions between t=0 and t=lotf_nitex.<br>

Controls the self-consistency.
<br>Positive values =>
this is the usual choice for doing the usual ground state (GS)
calculations or for structural relaxation, where
the potential has to be determined self-consistently.
The choice between different algorithms for SCF is possible :
<ul>
<li>=0 => SCF cycle, direct minimization scheme on the gradient of the wavefunctions. This algorithm is faster than diagonalisation and mixing but is working only for systems with a gap. It is implemented only on the wavelet basis set, when <a href="varbas.html#usewvl">usewvl</a>=1.</li>
<li>=1 => get the largest eigenvalue of the SCF cycle
<br>(DEVELOP option, used with
<a href="varfil.html#irdwfk">irdwfk</a>=1 or
<a href="varfil.html#irdwfk">irdwfq</a>=1)</li>
<li>=2 => SCF cycle, simple mixing of the potential</li>
<li>=3 => SCF cycle, Anderson mixing of the potential</li>
<li>=4 => SCF cycle, Anderson mixing of the potential based on the two previous iterations</li>
<li>=5 => SCF cycle, CG based on the minim. of the energy with respect to the potential</li>
<li>=7 => SCF cycle, Pulay mixing of the potential based on the <a href="vardev.html#npulayit">npulayit</a> previous iterations</li>
<li>=12 => SCF cycle, simple mixing of the density</li>
<li>=13 => SCF cycle, Anderson mixing of the density</li>
<li>=14 => SCF cycle, Anderson mixing of the density based on the two previous iterations</li>
<li>=15 => SCF cycle, CG based on the minim. of the energy with respect to the density</li>
<li>=17 => SCF cycle, Pulay mixing of the density based on the <a href="vardev.html#npulayit">npulayit</a> previous iterations</li>
<li>Other positive values, including zero ones, are not allowed. </li>
</ul>
<p>
Such algorithms for treating the "SCF iteration history" should be coupled with accompanying algorithms
for the SCF "preconditioning". See the input variable <a href="vargs.html#iprcel">iprcel</a>.
The default value <a href="vargs.html#iprcel">iprcel</a>=0 is often a good choice, but
for inhomogeneous systems, you might gain a lot with <a href="vargs.html#iprcel">iprcel</a>=45.
<p>
(Warning : if <b>iscf</b>&gt;10, at present (v4.6), the energy printed at each SCF cycle is not variational -
this should not affect the other properties, and at convergence, all values are OK)
<p>
- In the norm-conserving case,
the default option is <b>iscf</b>=7, which is a compromise between speed and reliability.
The value <b>iscf</b>= 2 is safer but slower.
<br>
- In the PAW case, default option is <b>iscf</b>=17.
In PAW you have the possibility to mix density/potential on the fine or coarse FFT grid (see <a href="varpaw.html#pawmixdg">pawmixdg</a>).
<br>- Note that a Pulay mixing (<b>iscf</b>=7 or 17) with <a href="vardev.html#npulayit">npulayit</a>
=1 (resp. 2) is equivalent to an Anderson mixing with <b>iscf</b>=3 or 13 (resp. 4 or 14).
<br>- Also note that: <br>* when mixing is done on potential (iscf</b><10), total energy is computed by "direct" decomposition.
<br>* when mixing is done on density (iscf</b>>=10), total energy is computed by "double counting" decomposition.
<br>"Direct" and "double counting" decomposition of energy are equal when SCF cycle is converged. Note that,
when using GGA XC functionals, these decompositions of energy can be slighty different due
to imprecise computation of density gradients on FFT grid (difference decreases as size of FFT grid increases -
see <a href="varbas.html#ecut">ecut</a> for NC pseudopotentials, <a href="varpaw.html#pawecutdg">pawecutdg</a> for PAW).
<br>
<br>Other (negative) options:
<ul>
<li>= -2 =>
a non-self-consistent calculation is to be done;
in this case an electron density rho(r) on a real space grid
(produced in a previous calculation) will be read from a
disk file (automatically if <a href="varbas.html#ndtset">ndtset</a>=0, or
according to the value of <a href="varfil.html#getden">getden</a>
if <a href="varbas.html#ndtset">ndtset</a>/=0).
<br>The name of the density file must be given as indicated
in the <a href="../users/abinit_help.html#4">section 4</a> of abinit_help.
<b>iscf</b>=-2 would be used for
band structure calculations, to permit computation of
the eigenvalues of occupied and unoccupied states at
arbitrary k points in the fixed self consistent potential
produced by some integration grid of k points.
Due to this typical use, ABINIT insist that either
<a href="varfil.html#prtvol">prtvol</a>&gt;2 or
<a href="varfil.html#prteig">prteig</a> does not vanish
when there are more than 50 k points.
<br>To compute the eigenvalues
(and wavefunctions) of unoccupied states in a separate
(non-selfconsistent) run, the user should
save the self-consistent rho(r)
and then run <b>iscf</b>=-2 for the intended set of k-points and bands.
<br>To prepare a run with <b>iscf</b>=-2, a density file
can be produced using the
parameter <a href="varfil.html#prtden">prtden</a> (see its description).
When a self-consistent set of wavefunctions is already available,
abinit can be used with
<a href="varbas.html#nstep">nstep</a>=0 (see Test_v2/t47.in),
and the adequate value of <a href="varfil.html#prtden">prtden</a>.
</li>
<li>= -3 =>
like -2, but initialize <a href="vargs.html#occ">occ</a> and <a href="varbas.html#wtk">wtk</a>,
directly or indirectly (using <a href="varbas.html#ngkpt">ngkpt</a> or
<a href="vargs.html#kptrlatt">kptrlatt</a>)
depending on the value of <a href="varbas.html#occopt">occopt</a>.
<br>For GS, this option
might be used to generate Density-of-states
(thanks to <a href="varfil.html#prtdos">prtdos</a>),
or to produce STM charge density map (thanks to <a href="varfil.html#prtstm">prtstm</a>).
<br>For RF, this option is needed to compute the response to ddk perturbation.</li>

<li>= -1 => like -2, but the non-self-consistent calculation
is followed by the determination of excited states
within TDDFT. This is only possible for <a href="varbas.html#nkpt">nkpt</a>=1,
with <a href="varbas.html#kpt">kpt</a>=0 0 0.
Note that the oscillator strength needs to be defined with respect to
an origin of coordinate, thanks to the input variable
<a href="vargs.html#boxcenter">boxcenter</a>. The maximal
number of Kohn-Sham excitations to be used to build the
excited state TDDFT matrix can be defined by <a href="varrf.html#td_mexcit">td_mexcit</a>,

<p><b> ETSF Lib XC functionals</b><p>
Note that you must compile ABINIT with the LibXC plug-in in order to be able to access these functionals.
<br>
The LibXC functionals are accessed by <b>negative values</b> of <b>ixc</b>.
The LibXC contains functional forms for either exchange-only functionals, correlation-only functionals,
or combined exchange and correlation functionals. Each of them is to be specified by a three-digit number.
In case of a combined exchange and correlation functional, only one such three-digit number has to be specified as value of <b>ixc</b>,
with a minus sign (to indicate that it comes from the LibXC).
In the case of separate exchange functional (let us represent its identifier by XXX) and
correlation functional (let us represent its identified by CCC),
a six-digit number will have to be specified for <b>ixc</b>, by concatenation, be it XXXCCC or CCCXXX.
As an example, <b>ixc</b>=-020 gives access to the Teter93 LDA, while
<b>ixc</b>=-101130 gives access to the PBE GGA.
In version 0.9 of LibXC (December 2008), there are 16 three-dimensional (S)LDA functionals (1 for X, 14 for C, 1 for combined XC),
and there are 41 three-dimensional GGA (23 for X, 8 for C, 10 for combined XC).
Note that for a meta-GGA, the kinetic energy density is needed. This means having <a href="vargs.html#usekden">usekden</a>=1 .

the conversion might be more difficult. See the description of <a href="varbas.html#kpt">kpt</a>
for an explanation of how to convert data from the "conventional" cartesian coordinates to
the primitive vectors in the reciprocal space. In order to help a bit, we list below a series
of typical values, for the FCC, BCC, hexagonal and rhombohedral Bravais lattices. Note : all the data below
are given in dimensionless units ; they have to be rescaled by the actual lengths defined by the
<a href="varbas.html#acell">acell</a> values. However, <b>kptbounds</b> values can be used as such,
if the values of <a href="varbas.html#rprim">rprim</a> given below are adopted.

<p>A. <b>FCC lattice</b>
<p>Suppose the primitive vectors in real space are given by
<br><pre>
rprim   0 1 1    1 0 1    1 1 0
</pre>
or
<pre>
rprim   0 1/2 1/2    1/2 0 1/2    1/2 1/2 0
</pre>
(these two possibilities only differ by a scaling factor, irrelevant for the definition
of the k points in the primitive vectors in reciprocal space).

Then, the reciprocal primitive vectors (in conventional cartesian coordinates) are
<pre>
(-1/2 1/2 1/2), (1/2 -1/2 1/2), (1/2 1/2 -1/2)
</pre>
or
<pre>
(-1 1 1), (1 -1 1), (1 1 -1)
</pre>
and, in both cases, the coordinates of several special points with respect to primitive vectors in reciprocal space are
<pre>
X (0   1/2 1/2)   (conventional cartesian coordinate 1/2 0 0)
X'(1/2 1/2 1  )   (conventional cartesian coordinate 1/2 1/2 0)  (an other instance of X, in another Brillouin zone)
L (1/2 1/2 1/2)   (conventional cartesian coordinate  1/4 1/4 1/4)
L'(1/2 0   0  )   (conventional cartesian coordinate -1/4 1/4 1/4) (an other instance of L, on another face of the BZ)
W (1/4 1/2 3/4)   (conventional cartesian coordinate 1/2 1/4 0)

K (3/8 3/8 3/4)   (conventional cartesian coordinate 3/8 3/8 0)
</pre>
Note that K is actually equivalent to U, by spatial and translational symmetry.
So, if you want to specify a typical circuit, the following might do the work :
L-Gamma-X-W-K,U-L-W-X-K,U-Gamma with
<br>
<pre>kptbounds  1/2 0 0  0 0 0  0 1/2 1/2  1/4 1/2 3/4  3/8 3/8 3/4  1/2 1/2 1/2  1/4 1/2 3/4  1/2 1/2 1  3/8 3/8 3/4  0 0 0</pre>
<p>
The lengths of segments (this information is useful to draw the band structure, with the correct relative
scale between special points)
can be found using
the conventional cartesian coordinates :
l(L-Gamma)=sqrt(3)/4=0.433... ;
l(Gamma-X)=1/2=0.5 ;
l(X-W)=1/4=0.25 ;

<br><pre>
rprim  -1 1 1    1 -1 1    1 1 -1
</pre>
(as for the FCC lattice, there is a scale invariance).
Then, the reciprocal primitive vectors (in conventional cartesian coordinates) are
(0 1/2 1/2), (1/2 0 1/2), and (1/2 1/2 0)
and the coordinates of several special points with respect to primitive vectors in reciprocal space are
<pre>
H (-1/2 1/2 1/2)   (conventional cartesian coordinate 1/2 0 0)

P ( 1/4 1/4 1/4)   (conventional cartesian coordinate 1/4 1/4 1/4)

<br>
<pre>kptbounds  0 0 0  -1/2 1/2 1/2  0 0 1/2  0 0 0   1/4 1/4 1/4  0 0 1/2  1/4 1/4 1/4  -1/2 1/2 1/2 </pre>
<p>
The lengths of segments (this information is useful to draw the band structure, with the correct relative scale between special points)
can be found using the conventional cartesian coordinates :
l(Gamma-H)=1/2=0.5 ;
l(H-N)=sqrt(2)/4=0.354... ;
l(N-Gamma)=sqrt(2)/4=0.354... ;
l(Gamma-P)=sqrt(3)/4=0.433... ;
l(P-N)=1/4=0.25 ;
l(N-P)=1/4=0.25 ;
l(P-H)=sqrt(3)/4=0.433...
<p>

<p>C. <b>Hexagonal lattices</b>
<p>Suppose the primitive vectors in real space are given by
<br><pre>
rprim  1 0 0    -1/2 sqrt(0.75) 0    0 0 1
</pre>
The coordinates of several special points with respect to primitive vectors in reciprocal space are
<pre>
M (1/2 0 0) or (0 1/2 0) or (-1/2 1/2 0)
L (1/2 0 1/2) or (0 1/2 1/2) or (-1/2 1/2 1/2)

H (1/3 1/3 1/2) or (2/3 -1/3 1/2) or (-1/3 2/3 1/2)
A (0 0 1/2)
</pre>
So, if you want to specify a typical circuit, the following might do the work :
K-Gamma-M-K-H-A-L-H-L-M-Gamma-A
<br>
<pre>kptbounds  1/3 1/3 0  0 0 0  1/2 0 0  1/3 1/3 0  1/3 1/3 1/2  0 0 1/2  1/2 0 1/2  1/3 1/3 1/2  1/2 0 1/2  1/2 0 0  0 0 0  0 0 1/2 </pre>
<p>
In order to find the lengths of segments
(this information is useful to draw the band structure,
with the correct relative scale between special points)
one needs to know the a and c lattice parameters. Also, in what follows, we omit the 2*pi factor sometimes
present in the definition of the reciprocal space vectors.
The reciprocal vectors are (1/a 1/(sqrt(3)*a) 0) , (0 2/(sqrt(3)*a) 0), (0 0 1/c). The lengths of

<p>

<p>D. <b>Rhombohedral lattices</b>
<p>Rhombohedral lattices are characterised by two parameters, the length of the primitive
vectors, that we will denote a0, and the angle they form, alpha.
These can be directly input of ABINIT, as
<a href="varbas.html#acell">acell</a> and <a href="varbas.html#angdeg">angdeg</a>
<p>This will generate the primitive vectors in real space , with
<pre>
<a href="varbas.html#acell">acell</a> a0 a0 a0    and      <a href="varbas.html#rprim">rprim</a>  a 0 c    -a/2 a*sqrt(0.75) c    -a/2 -a*sqrt(0.75) c
</pre>
with a^2+c^2=1, a^2=(1-cos(alpha))*2/3, c^2=(1+2*cos(alpha))*1/3, (a/c)^2=2*(1-cos(alpha))/(1+2*cos(alpha))
and also cos(alpha)=(1-(a/c)^2/2)/(1+(a/c)^2).
Alternatively, these values of rprim might directly be the input of ABINIT (then, the balance
of the scaling factor might be adjusted between
<a href="varbas.html#acell">acell</a> and <a href="varbas.html#rprim">rprim</a>).
<p>
Unlike for the simple cubic, FCC, BCC, hexagonal (and some other) Bravais lattice,
the topology of the Brillouin zone will depend on the alpha (or a/c) value. We give below
information concerning the case when cos(alpha) is positive, that is, (a/c)^2 lower than 2.
<p>
The coordinates of several special points with respect to primitive vectors in reciprocal space will
not depend on the a/c ratio, but some others will depend on it. So, some care has to be exercised.
Notations for the Brillouin Zone special points are the same as in Phys. Rev. B 41, 11827 (1990).
<pre>
L (1/2 0 0) or (0 1/2 0) or (0 0 1/2) (or with negative signs)
T (1/2 1/2 1/2)
X (1/2 1/2 0) or (1/2 0 1/2) or (0 1/2 1/2) (or with separate negative signs)
W (5/6 - (a/c)^2/6 , 1/2 , 1/6 + (a/c)^2/6 ) = (1 0 -1)*(1-(a/c)^2/2)/3 + (1 1 1)/2
U ( (1+(a/c)^2)/6 , (8-(a/c)^2)/12 , (8-(a/c)^2)/12 ) = (-1 1/2 1/2)*(1-(a/c)^2/2)/3 + (1 1 1)/2
K (1 0 -1)*(1+(a/c)^2/4)/3
</pre>
So, if you want to specify a typical circuit, the following might do the work (the representative points on lines of symmetry are indicated - there are sometimes more than one way to go from one point to another) :
X-V-K-Sigma-Gamma-Lambda-T-Q-W-Y-L-sigma-Gamma-sigma-X . The suggestion is to sample this path
with the following coordinates
for the special points X, Gamma, T, L, Gamma, X :
<br>
<pre>kptbounds  1/2 0 -1/2   0 0 0    1/2 1/2 1/2  1 1/2 0   1 0 0  1 1/2 1/2
</pre>
<p>
In order to find the lengths of segments
(this information is useful to draw the band structure,
with the correct relative scale between special points)
one needs to know the a and c lattice parameters. Also, in what follows, we omit the 2*pi factor sometimes
present in the definition of the reciprocal space vectors.
The reciprocal vectors are (2/(3*a) 0 1/(3*c)) , -(1/(3*a) 1/(sqrt(3)*a) 1/(3*c), -(1/(3*a) -1/(sqrt(3)*a) 1/(3*c) ). The lengths of
the above-mentioned segments can be computed as :
l(X-Gamma)=2/(sqrt(3)*a)=1.155.../a , with l(K-Gamma)=(1+(a/c)^2/4)*4/(3*sqrt(3)*a);
l(Gamma-T)=1/(2*c) ;
l(T-L)=2/(sqrt(3)*a)=1.155.../a , with l(T-W)=(1-(a/c)^2/2)*4/(3*sqrt(3)*a);
l(L-Gamma)=sqrt(4/(a^2)+1/(c^2))/3
l(Gamma-X)=sqrt(1/(a^2)+1/(c^2))*2/3

This input variable is used only when <a href="varbas.html#kptopt">kptopt</a>

<p>Preliminary explanation :
<br>
The k point lattice defined by <a href="varbas.html#ngkpt">ngkpt</a>
or <a href="vargs.html#kptrlatt">kptrlatt</a> is used to perform integrations
of periodic quantities in the Brillouin Zone, like
the density or the kinetic energy. One can relate the
error made by replacing the continuous integral by a sum
over k point lattice to the Fourier transform of the
periodic quantity. Erroneous contributions will appear
only for the vectors in real space that belong to the reciprocal
of the k point lattice, except the origin.
Moreover, the expected size of these
contributions usually decreases exponentially with the distance.
So, the length of the smallest of these real space vectors
is a measure of the accuracy of the k point grid.

<p>When either <a href="varbas.html#ngkpt">ngkpt</a> or
<a href="vargs.html#kptrlatt">kptrlatt</a> is defined, <b>kptrlen</b> is not
used as an input variable, but the length of the
smallest vector will be placed in this variable, and echoed
in the output file.

<p>On the other hand, when neither <a href="varbas.html#ngkpt">ngkpt</a> nor
<a href="vargs.html#kptrlatt">kptrlatt</a> are defined, ABINIT will
automatically generate a large set of possible k point grids,
and select among this set, the grids that give
a length of smallest vector LARGER than <b>kptrlen</b>,
and among these grids, the one that, when used with
<a href="varbas.html#kptopt">kptopt</a>=1, reduces to the smallest number
of k points. Note that this procedure can be time-consuming.
It is worth doing it once for a given unit cell
and set of symmetries, but not use this procedure by default.
The best is then to set <a href="varfil.html#prtkpt">prtkpt</a>=1, in order
to get a detailed analysis of the set of grids.

<p>If some layer of vacuum is detected in the unit cell
(see the input variable <a href="vargs.html#vacuum">vacuum</a>), the
computation of <b>kptrlen</b> will ignore the
dimension related to the direction perpendicular
to the vacuum layer, and generate a bi-dimensional k point grid.
If the system is confined in a tube,
a one-dimensional k point grid will be generated.
For a cluster, this procedure will only generate the Gamma point.

of the basic <a href="vargs.html#npspalch">npspalch</a> pseudopotentials for

potential will be :
<pre>
npsp   4                 ! 4 pseudopotentials should be read.

! Hence, there will be ntyppure=2 pure pseudoatoms,
! with znucl 8 (O) and 40 (Ti), corresponding to
! the two first pseudopotentials. Out of the
! four pseudopotentials, npspalch=2 are left
! for alchemical purposes, with znucl 56 (Ba)
! and 38 (Sr).
mixalch    0.25  0.75    ! For that unique pseudoatom to be
! generated, here are the mixing coeeficients,
! to be used to combine the Ba and Sr pseudopotentials.
</pre>
<p> Example 2. More complicated, and illustrate some minor drawback of the
design of input variables.
Suppose that one wants to generate Al(0.25)Ga(0.75) As(0.10)Sb(0.90).
<br> The input variables will be :
<pre>
npsp  4                  ! 4 pseudopotentials should be read
znucl  13 31 33 51       ! The atomic numbers. All pseudopotentials
! will be used for some alchemical purpose
ntypat  2                ! There will be two types of atoms.
ntypalch   2             ! None of the atoms will be "pure".
! Hence, there will be npspalch=4 pseudopotentials
!  to be used for alchemical purposes.
mixalch    0.25  0.75 0.0  0.0   ! This array is a (4,2) array, arranged in the
0.0   0.0  0.1  0.9   ! usual Fortran order.
</pre>
Minor drawback : one should not forget to fill <b>mixalch</b> with the needed zero's, in this later case.
<p> In most cases, the use of <b>mixalch</b>
will be as a static (non-evolving) variable. However, the possibility to have
different values of <b>mixalch</b> for different images has been coded. A population of
cells with different atomic characteristics can thus be considered,
and can be made to evolve, e.g. with a genetic algorithm (not coded in v7.0.0 though).
There is one restriction to this possibility : the value of <a href="varint.html#ziontypat">ziontypat</a> for the atoms that are mixed should be
identical.

<b>nbdbuf</b> gives the number of bands, the highest in energy, that,

in non-self-consistent
calculations, for the determination of the convergence tolerance ;
for response functions of metals, to avoid instabilities,
and also when finite electric fields or non-linear responses (with electric field
perturbations) are considered.
For the two first, the need of a buffer is a natural requirement
of the problem, so that the default value is changed to 2 automatically,
as explained in the following.
The third case is only for implementation convenience.

<p> In non-self-consistent GS calculations (<a href="varbas.html#iscf">iscf</a>&lt;0),
the highest levels might be
difficult to converge, if they are degenerate with another level,
that does not belong to the set of bands treated. Then, it might
take extremely long to reach <a href="varbas.html#tolwfr">tolwfr</a>, although
the other bands are already extremely well-converged, and the energy
of the highest bands (whose residual are not yet good enough), is
also rather well converged.
<br> In response to this problem, for non-zero <b>nbdbuf</b>, the
largest residual (residm), to be later compared with <a href="varbas.html#tolwfr">tolwfr</a>,

for GS as well as RF calculations).
<br> For a GS calculation, with <a href="varbas.html#iscf">iscf</a>&lt;0, supposing
<b>nbdbuf</b> is not initialized in the input file,
then ABINIT will overcome the default <b>nbdbuf</b> value,
and automatically set <b>nbdbuf</b> to 2.
<p> In metallic RF calculations, in the conjugate gradient optimisation
of first-order wavefunctions, there is an instability situation
when the q wavevector of the perturbation brings the eigenenergy of the
highest treated band at some k point higher than the lowest
untreated eigenenergy at some k+q point.
If one accepts a buffer of frozen states, this instability can be made to
disappear. Frozen states receive automatically a residual value of -0.1d0.
<br> For a RF calculation, with 3&lt;=<a href="varbas.html#occopt">occopt</a>&lt;=7,
supposing
<b>nbdbuf</b> is not initialized in the input file, then
ABINIT will overcome the default <b>nbdbuf</b> value,

in array "<a href="varbas.html#tnons">tnons</a>".  If there is no symmetry in the problem
then set <b>nsym</b> to 1, because the identity is still a symmetry.

<br>In case of a RF calculation, the code is able to use
the symmetries of the system to decrease the number of
perturbations to be calculated, and to decrease of the
number of special k points to be used for the sampling of
the Brillouin zone.
After the response to the perturbations have been calculated,
the symmetries are used to generate as many as
possible elements of the 2DTE from those already
computed.

<p>SYMMETRY FINDER mode (Default mode).
If <b>nsym</b> is 0, all the atomic coordinates must be
explicitely given (one cannot use the geometry builder
and the symmetrizer): the code will then find automatically
the symmetry operations that leave the lattice and each
atomic sublattice invariant. It also checks whether the
cell is primitive (see <a href="vargs.html#chkprim">chkprim</a>).
<br>Note that the tolerance on symmetric atomic positions and
lattice is rather stringent :
for a symmetry operation to be admitted,
the lattice and atomic positions must map on themselves
within 1.0e-8 .

<p>The user is allowed to set up systems with non-primitive unit cells (i.e.
conventional FCC or BCC cells, or supercells without any distortion).
In this case, pure translations will be identified as symmetries
of the system by the symmetry finder.
Then, the combined "pure translation + usual rotation and inversion" symmetry
operations can be very numerous. For example, a conventional FCC cell
has 192 symmetry operations, instead of the 48 ones of the primitive cell.
A maximum limit of 384 symmetry operations is hard-coded. This
corresponds to the maximum number of symmetry operations of a 2x2x2
undistorted supercell. Going beyond
that number will make the code stop very rapidly. If you want
nevertheless, for testing purposes, to treat a larger number of symmetries,
change the initialization of "msym" in the abinit.F90 main routine,
then recompile the code.

<p>For GW calculation, the user might want to select only the symmetry operations whose
non-symmorphic translation vector <a href="varbas.html#tnons">tnons</a>
is zero. This can be done with the help of the input variable

<b>If paral_kgb=-n </b>, ABINIT will test automatically if all the processor numbers between 2 and n are convenient for a parallel calculation and print the possible values in the log file.

<br><br>
<B> In plasmon-pole calculations</B>
<p>
In the present status of the GW code, the convolution in frequency space
defining the self-energy operator can be evaluated using two different approaches:
numerical integration and plasmon-pole models.
<br>
Methods based on the numerical integration (contour deformation, analytic continuation) require
the knowledge of the screened interaction for several frequencies. These approaches give
the most accurate results but at the price of an increase in the CPU time required.
<br>
Alternatively, it is possible to approximate the dynamical behaviour of the screened interaction
through simple analytical expressions, the so-called plasmon-pole models.
In the plasmon-pole model proposed by Godby-Needs (<a href="vargw.html#ppmodel">ppmodel</a>=1),
the screening must be available at zero frequency, as well as at another imaginary frequency,
of the order of the plasmon frequency (the peak in the EELS spectrum).
This information is used to model the behaviour of the dielectric matrix
for all frequencies.
During the calculation of the screening, <b>ppmfrq</b> defines the imaginary frequency where the
dielectric matrix is evaluated, in addition to the zero frequency.
During the self-energy run, <b>ppmfrq</b> can be used to define the second frequency to be used
to calculate the plasmon-pole parameters. This is particularly useful when the
SCR file contains several frequencies along the imaginary axis.
In this case the frequency whose value is the closest one to <b>ppmfrq</b> will be selected.
Note that, if the plasmon-pole approximation is good, then, the
choice of <b>ppmfrq</b> should have no influence on the final result.
One should check whether this is the case. In general, the plasmon frequencies of bulk solids
are of the order of 0.5 Hartree.
<br><br>
<B> In Contour Deformation calculations</B>
<p>
<b>ppmfrq</b> is here used to <b>override</b> the default value calculated from the average electronic
density per unit cell. This can affect the distribution of gridpoints along the imaginary and

<p>Additional Notes:

<ul>
<li>An input file of LDA wave functions is required which is completely
consistent with the _KSS file used in the self-consistent GW calculation.
This means that <a href="varfil.html#kssform">kssform</a> 3 must be used
to create the _KSS file and the output _WFK file from the same run must
be used as input here.
<li>Wannier90 requires <a href="varbas.html#nshiftk">nshiftk</a>=1, and
<a href="varbas.html#shiftk">shiftk</a>= 0 0 0 is recommended.  The k-point
set used for the GW calculation, typically the irreducible BZ set created
using <a href="varbas.html#kptopt">kptopt</a>=1, and that for the Abinit-
Wannier90 interface must be consistent.
<li>Full-BZ wavefunctions should be generated in the run calling the
interface by setting <a href="varbas.html#kptopt">kptopt</a>=3,
<a href="varbas.html#iscf">iscf</a>=-2, and
<a href="varbas.html#nstep">nstep</a>=3.  This will simply use symmetry to
transform the input IBZ wavefunctions to the full BZ set, still consistent
with the GW _KSS input.
<li>The final _QPS file created by the self-consistent GW run is required
as input.
<li>Any value of <a href="vargw.html#gwcalctyp">gwcalctyp</a> between
between 20 and 29 should be suitable, so, for example, Hartree-Fock
maximally-localized Wannier functions could be generated setting

If <b>prtwf</b>=1 , provide output of wavefunction
and eigenvalue file, as described in
<a href="../users/abinit_help.html#wavefctfile">section 6.7</a> of the main abinit help file.

the root name will be followed by _WFQ. For response-function calculations,
the root name will be followed by _1WFx, where x is the number of the perturbation.
The dataset information will be added as well, if relevant.
<br>No wavefunction output is provided by <b>prtwf</b>=0.
<p>
<br>If <b>prtwf</b>=2, a file pwfn.data is produced, to be used as input for the
CASINO QMC code. See more explanation at the end of this section.
<br>If <b>prtwf</b>=3, the file that is created is nearly the same as with <b>prtwf</b>=1,
except that the records that should contain the wavefunction is empty (so, such records exist, but store nothing).
This is useful to generate size-reduced DDK files,
to perform an optic run. Indeed, in the latter case, only matrix elements are needed [so, no wavefunction], but possibly
a large number of conduction bands, so that the DDK file might be huge if it contains the wavefunctions.

<p>Further explanation for the <b>prtwf</b>=2 case. To produce a wave function suitable for use as a CASINO trial wave
function, certain ABINIT parameters must be set correctly. Primarily,
CASINO (and QMC methods generally) can only take advantage of
time-reversal symmetry, and not the full set of symmetries of the crystal
structure. Therefore, ABINIT must be instructed to generate k-points not
just in the Irreducible Brillouin Zone, but in a full half of the
Brillouin Zone (using time-reversal symmetry to generate the other half).
Additionally, unless instructed otherwise, Abinit avoids the need for
internal storage of many of the coefficients of its wave functions for
k-points that have the property 2k=G_latt, where G_latt is a reciprocal
lattice vector, by making use of the property that
c_k(G)=c^*_k(-G-G_latt). Abinit must be instructed not to do this in order
to output the full set of coefficients for use in CASINO. See the ABINIT
theoretical background documents ABINIT/Infos/Theory/geometry.pdf and
ABINIT/Infos/Theory/1WF.pdf for more information.
<br>
The first of these requirements is met by setting the ABINIT input
variable kptopt to 2 (see ABINIT/Infos/varbas.html#kptopt) and the second
by setting istwfk to 1 for all the k points (see
ABINIT/Infos/vardev.html#istwfk). Since CASINO is typically run with
relatively small numbers of k-points, this is easily done by defining an
array of 1's in the input file.
<br>
For example, for the 8 k-points generated with ngkpt 2 2 2, we add the
following lines to the input file:
<pre>
# Turn off special storage mode for time-reversal k-points
istwfk 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
# Use only time reversal symmetry, not full set of symmetries.
kptopt 2
</pre>
Other useful input variables of relevance to the plane waves ABINIT will
produce include ecut, nshiftk, shiftk, nband, occopt, occ, spinat and
nsppol (see relevant input variable documents in ABINIT/Infos/). If ABINIT
is run in multiple dataset mode, the different wave functions for the
various datasets are exported as pwfn1.data, pwfn2.data, ..., pwfnn.data
where the numbers are the contents of the contents of the input array
jdtset (defaults to 1,2,...,ndtset).
<br>
Once the routine is incorporated into the ABINIT package it is anticipated
that there will be an input variable to control whether or not a CASINO
pwfn.data file is written.
<p>
Other issues related to <b>prtwf</b>=2.
<br>
The exporter does not currently work when ABINIT is used in parallel mode
on multiple processors if k-point parallelism is
chosen. ABINIT does not store the full wave function on each processor but
rather splits the k-points between the processors, so no one processor
could write out the whole file. Clearly this could be fixed but we haven't
done it yet. The sort of plane wave DFT calculations usually required to
generate QMC trial wave functions execute very rapidly anyway and will
generally not require a parallel machines. The outqmc routine currently
bails out with an error if this combination of modes is selected - this
will hopefully be fixed later.
<br>
There has not been very extensive testing of less common situations such
as different numbers of bands for different k-points, and more complicated
spin polarized systems, so care should be taken when using the output in
these circumstances.
<br>
If there is any doubt about the output of this routine, the first place to
look is the log file produced by ABINIT: if there are any warnings about
incorrectly normalized orbitals or non-integer occupation numbers there is
probably something set wrong in the input file.

(in version 4.2, this procedure is NOT implemented, unfortunately) :
from the Bader analysis, one can define the radius of the sphere
that contains the same charge as the Bader volume. This
"Equivalent Bader charge atomic radius" might then be used to perform
the present analysis.
See the <A href="../users/aim_help.html"><B>AIM (Bader)</B></a> help file for more explanations.
Another physically motivated choice would be to rely on another
charge partitioning, like the Hirshfeld one (see the cut3d utility).
The advantage of using charge partitioning schemes comes from the fact that the
sum of atomic DOS, for all angular momenta and atoms, integrated on the
energy range of the occupied states,
gives back the total charge.
If this is not an issue, one could rely on the half of the nearest-neighbour distances, or
any scheme that allows to define an atomic radius. Note that the choice of this
radius is however critical for the balance between the s, p and d components. Indeed,
the integrated charge within a given radius, behave as a different power of the
radius, for the different channels s, p, d. At the limit of very small radii, the s component
dominates the charge contained in the sphere ...
<br><br>When <a href="vargs.html#prtdensph">prtdensph</a>=1:<br>
Provides the radius of the spheres around (all) atoms in which the total charge density will be integrated.
<br><br>In case of PAW, <a href="vargs.html#ratsph">ratsph</a> radius has to be greater or equal to
PAW radius of considered atom type (which is read from the PAW dataset file; see rc_sph or r_paw).

Give, in columnwise entry,
the three dimensionless primitive translations in real space, to be rescaled by
<a href="varbas.html#acell">acell</a> and <a href="varbas.html#scalecart">scalecart</a>.
<br>If the Default is used, that is, <b>rprim</b> is the unity matrix,
the three dimensionless primitive vectors are three
unit vectors in cartesian coordinates. Each will be (possibly) multiplied
by the corresponding <a href="varbas.html#acell">acell</a> value, then (possibly)
stretched along the cartesian coordinates by the corresponding <a href="varbas.html#scalecart">scalecart</a> value,
to give the dimensional primitive vectors, called <a href="varbas.html#rprimd">rprimd</a>.
<br>In the general case, the dimensional cartesian
coordinates of the crystal primitive translations R1p, R2p and R3p, see
<a href="varbas.html#rprimd">rprimd</a>, are
<ul>
<li>  R1p(i)=<a href="varbas.html#scalecart">scalecart</a>(i)<b>rprim</b>(i,1)*<a href="varbas.html#acell">acell</a>(1) </li>

</ul>
where i=1,2,3 is the component of the primitive translation (i.e. x, y, and z).
<br>
<br>
The <b>rprim</b> variable, scaled by <a href="varbas.html#scalecart">scalecart</a>, is thus used to define directions
of the primitive vectors, that will be multiplied (so keeping the direction unchanged) by
the appropriate length scale <a href="varbas.html#acell">acell</a>(1), <a href="varbas.html#acell">acell</a>(2),
or <a href="varbas.html#acell">acell</a>(3),
respectively to give the dimensional primitive translations
in real space in cartesian coordinates.
<br>
Presently, it is requested that the mixed product
(R1xR2).R3 is positive. If this is not the case,
simply exchange a pair of vectors.
<br>
To be more specific, keeping the default value of <a href="varbas.html#scalecart">scalecart</a>=1 to simplify the matter,
<b>rprim</b> 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 corresponds to input of the
three primitive translations R1=(1,2,3) (to be multiplied by <a
href="varbas.html#acell">acell</a>(1)), R2=(4,5,6) (to be multiplied by <a
href="varbas.html#acell">acell</a>(2)), and R3=(7,8,9) (to be multiplied by <a
href="varbas.html#acell">acell</a>(3)).
<br>
Note carefully that the first
three numbers input are the first column of <b>rprim</b>, the next
three are the second, and the final three are the third.
This corresponds with the usual Fortran order for arrays.
The matrix whose columns are the reciprocal space primitive
translations is the inverse transpose of the matrix whose
columns are the direct space primitive translations.
<p>Alternatively to <b>rprim</b>, directions of dimensionless primitive
vectors can be specified by using the input variable <a href="varbas.html#angdeg">angdeg</a>.
This is especially useful for hexagonal lattices (with 120 or 60 degrees angles).
Indeed, in order for symmetries to be recognized, rprim must be symmetric up to
<a href="vargeo.html#tolsym">tolsym</a> (10 digits by default),
inducing a specification such as
<pre>
rprim  0.86602540378  0.5  0.0
-0.86602540378  0.5  0.0
0.0            0.0  1.0
</pre>
that can be avoided thanks to <a href="varbas.html#angdeg">angdeg</a>:
<pre>
angdeg 90 90 120
</pre>
<br>Although the use of <a href="varbas.html#scalecart">scalecart</a> or <a href="varbas.html#acell">acell</a> is
rather equivalent when the primitive vectors are aligned with the cartesian directions, it is not the case for
non-orthogonal primitive vectors. In particular, beginners often make the error of trying to use <a href="varbas.html#acell">acell</a>
to define primitive vectors in face-centered tetragonal lattice, or body-centered tetragonal lattice, or similarly
in face or body-centered orthorhombic lattices. Let's take the example of a body-centered tetragonal lattice, that
might be defined using the following ("a" and "c" have to be replaced by the appropriate conventional cell vector length):
<pre>
rprim  "a"      0      0
0      "a"     0
"a/2"   "a/2"  "c/2"
acell 3*1     scalecart 3*1    !  ( These are default values)
</pre>
The following is a valid, alternative way to define  the same primitive vectors :
<pre>
rprim   1       0      0
0       1      0
1/2     1/2    1/2
scalecart  "a"  "a"  "c"
acell 3*1    !  ( These are default values)
</pre>
Indeed, the cell has been stretched along the cartesian coordinates, by "a", "a" and "c" factors.
<p>
At variance, the following is WRONG :
<pre>
rprim   1       0      0
0       1      0
1/2     1/2    1/2
acell  "a"  "a"  "c"    !   THIS IS WRONG
scalecart 3*1    !  ( These are default values)
</pre>
Indeed, the latter would correspond to :
<pre>
rprim  "a"      0      0
0      "a"     0
"c/2"   "c/2"  "c/2"
acell 3*1     scalecart 3*1    !  ( These are default values)
</pre>
Namely, the third vector has been rescaled by "c". It is not at all in the center of the tetragonal cell whose basis vectors
are defined by the scaling factor "a".
<br> As another difference between <a href="varbas.html#scalecart">scalecart</a> or <a href="varbas.html#acell">acell</a>,
note that <a href="varbas.html#scalecart">scalecart</a> is <a href="../users/abinit_help.html#not_internal">NOT INTERNAL</a> :
its content will be immediately applied to rprim, at parsing time,
and then scalecart will be set to the default values (3*1). So, in case <a href="varbas.html#scalecart">scalecart</a> is used,
the echo of <b>rprim</b> in the output file is not the value contained in the input file,
but the value rescaled by <a href="varbas.html#scalecart">scalecart</a>.

The <b>spmeth</b> input variable defines the method used to calculate the irreducible
polarizability $\chi^{(0)}_{KS}$.
<p>
By default $\chi^{(0)}_{KS}$ is calculated employing the Adler-Wiser expression (<b>spmeth</b>=0)
with a CPU effort that scales linearly with the number of frequencies.
This approach is convenient when few frequencies are required, and is usually
used in conjunction with plasmon-pole models in which only one or two frequencies are calculated,

<br>
Unfortunately a calculation based on the Adler-Wiser expression might be quite CPU demanding
if the matrix elements of the self-energy operator are evaluated by performing numerically
the convolution defining the self-energy.
The integrand function, indeed, has poles above and below the real axis, and
the screened interaction has to be evaluated on a dense frequency mesh in order to obtain accurate
results.
<p>
In the spectral method (<b>spmeth</b>=1 or 2) the irreducible polarizability is expressed as
the Hilbert transform of the imaginary part.
The advantage in using this approach consists in the fact that, once the spectral function is known,
the irreducible polarizability for an arbitrary frequency can be easily obtained through inexpensive
integrations. On the other hand an accurate evaluation of the imaginary part requires a dense
frequency mesh due to the presence of delta functions.
Two different approaches can be used to approximate these delta functions thus allowing the use
of affordable frequency grids.

<p>
<b>vcutgeo</b> is used in conjunction with <a href="vargw.html#icutcoul">icutcoul</a>
to specify the geometry used to truncate the Coulomb interaction as well as the
particular approach to be used.
It has a meaning only for the cylindrical symmetry
(<a href="vargw.html#icutcoul">icutcoul</a>=1) or in the case of surfaces
<a href="vargw.html#icutcoul">icutcoul</a>=2.
For each geometry, two different definition of the cutoff region are available
(see Phys. Rev. B 73, 233103 and Phys. Rev. B 73, 205119 for a complete description of the methods)
<p>
In Beigi's method (Phys. Rev. B 73, 233103), the cutoff region is given by the Wigner-Seitz cell
centered on the axis of the cylinder.
The cutoff region is thus automatically defined by the unit cell and there's no need to specify
When <a href="vargw.html#rcut">rcut</a>.
<p>
To define a cylinder along the z-axis use the following two lines.

icutcoul 1
rprim    1 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 1
vcutgeo  0 0 1

<p>
Please note that Beigi's method is implemented only in the case if an orthorombic
Bravais lattic. For hexagonal lattices, one has to use the method of Rozzi (Phys. Rev. B 73, 205119)
In this case, the interaction is truncated in a finite cylinder.
Contrarily to the first approach, here one has to specify both the radius of the cylinder
with <a href="vargw.html#rcut">rcut</a>
as well as the length of the cylinder along the periodic dimension that should always be smaller
than the extension of the Born von Karman box.
The length of the cylinder is given in terms of the primitive vector along the periodic direction.
<p>
For example, in order to define a finite cylinder along z of radius 2.5 Bohr and length 3*R3

icutcoul 1
rprim    1 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 1
vcutgeo  0 0 -3.0 # note the minus sign
rcut     2.5

<p>
For surface calculations (<a href="vargw.html#icutcoul">icutcoul</a>=2),
<b>vcutgeo</b> is used to define the two periodic directions defining the surface.
Also in this case two different techniques are available.
In the method of Beigi, the (positive) non-zero components of vcutgeo define the periodic
directions of the infinite surface. The interaction is truncated within a slab
of width L where L is the length of the primitive vector of the lattice along the non-periodic dimension.
For example:

icutcoul 2
rprim    1 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 1
vcutgeo 1 1 0

It is also possible to define a finite surface by employing negative values
For example:

icutcoul 2
vcutgeo -3 -2 0

Note that in order to reduce the size of the UNK files we are just
including records in the wavefunctions for 1/(w90prtunk^3) of the grid points.
That is why we divide n1, n2 and n3 by prtunk. The output .xsf files for plotting
with XCrysDen will also be on the coarse grid.  When this dosen't produce an
acceptable plot, prtunk can be set to 1 to output every grid point.

Gives nuclear charge for each

as given in pseudopotential files, the program writes
an error message and stops.
<p>N.B. : In the pseudopotential files, <b>znucl</b> is called "zatom".
<p>For a "dummy" atom, with znucl=0 , as used in the case of calculations
with only a jellium surface, ABINIT sets arbitrarily the covalent radius to one.
